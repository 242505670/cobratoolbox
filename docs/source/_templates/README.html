The COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox is a MATLAB software suite for quantitative prediction of cellular and multicellular biochemical networks with constraint-based modelling. It implements a comprehensive collection of basic and advanced modelling methods, including reconstruction and model generation as well as biased and unbiased model-driven analysis methods.</p>

<p>It is widely used for modelling, analysing and predicting a variety of metabolic phenotypes using genome-scale biochemical networks.</p>
