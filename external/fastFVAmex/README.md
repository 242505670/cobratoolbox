Installation

**Please make sure that you have CPLEX installed. You must have IBM/ILOG CPLEX, not the TOMLAB version.**

For **Windows**, please follow [these instructions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.6.1/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Windows.html) to properly configure CPLEX. Please make sure that you install CPLEX 12.6.2+ into `C:\Program Files\IBM\ILOG\`. Do not install `CPLEX` into the root folder.

In order to generate the MEX file, you must have a compiler installed that is compatible with your MATLAB release. You need to install a C++ compiler if you haven't done so already, e. g. The Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2008 compiler which is available free of charge. Depending on your Matlab version, you must verify the supported compiler [here](http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers).

## Linux

Make sure to have `gcc` installed. You  can download it from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC).

## Windows

You may find information on how to install `gcc` [here](http://preshing.com/20141108/how-to-install-the-latest-gcc-on-windows/). For R2015b, you should have the Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4 installed. Note: Please make sure that you have the correct C++ Redistributable package. The compiler and SDK can be downloaded from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279). Other compilers that are compatible with R2015b can be found [here](http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/files/SystemRequirements-Release2015b_SupportedCompilers.pdf). In order to have the compiler set up properly, you must start MATLAB and run
```
mex -setup
```

***Note for Matlab R2016b***

Currently, the default Compiler MinGW64 is not compatible and *cannot* be used to generate a new MEX file. The error is traced back to an issue with the cplex1263.lib file not being compiled properly using the MINGW64 compiler. Even specifying the option -D_LP64 and changing CFLAGS into COMPFLAGS does not work.

This issue is already tracked [here](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-mingw-support-package.html) and mentioned as a limitation of using existing `.lib` files: `Library (.lib) files generated by MicrosoftÂ® Visual StudioÂ® are not compatible with MinGW.`

If you have instaled MinGW64, uninstall MinGW64 and install the SDK and the latest cygwin. Then, re-run `mex -setup`

## Generation of MEX files

In order to generate the MEX file, please run_exps
```
>> generateMexFile
```
