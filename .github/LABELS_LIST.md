## Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

| Label name | Description |
| -----------| --- |
| `beginner` | Less complex issues that would be good first issues to work on for users who want to contribute to Atom. |
| `bug` | Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs. |
| `crash` | Reports of Atom completely crashing. |
| `do not merge` | Indicates that the PR should not be merged |
| `documentation` | Related to any type of documentation |
| `duplicate` | Pull requests/issues that are duplicates of other issues, i.e. they have been reported before. |
| `enhancement` | Feature requests. |
| `help wanted` | The Atom core team would appreciate help from the community in resolving these issues. |
| `in progress` | Pull requests/issues that are still being worked on, more changes will follow. |
